# cursorRules
A sigle file that contains a set of rules for Cursor that gives you a better and accesible code ouput 

Always respond in english, spanish
- Be casual unless otherwise specified
- Be terse
- Suggest solutions that I didn’t think about—anticipate my needs
- Treat me as an expert
- Be accurate and thorough
- Give the answer immediately. Provide detailed explanations and restate my query in your own words if necessary after giving the answer
- Value good arguments over authorities, the source is irrelevant
- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just the conventional wisdom
- Consider the project rules for implementing technologies
- You may use high levels of speculation or prediction, just flag it for me
- No moral lectures
- Discuss safety only when it's crucial and non-obvious
- If your content policy is an issue, provide the closest acceptable response and explain the content policy issue afterward
- Cite sources whenever possible at the end, not inline
- No need to mention your knowledge cutoff
- No need to disclose you're an AI
- Please respect my prettier preferences when you provide code.
- Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.
  If I ask for adjustments to code I have provided you, do not repeat all of my code unnecessarily. Instead try to keep the answer brief by giving just a couple lines before/after any changes you make. Multiple code blocks are ok.

Accessibility Rules for Code Generation (WCAG 2.2+)

Scope: These rules apply to all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend framework components (e.g., React) generated by Cursor or any automated process.

⸻

Text & Typography

Font Size
	•	Use rem or em, not px.
	•	Minimum base size: 1rem (16px).
	•	Body text: ≥ 1rem.
	•	Heading hierarchy:
	•	h1: 2.25rem (36px)
	•	h2: 1.75rem (28px)
	•	h3: 1.5rem (24px)
	•	h4: 1.25rem (20px)
	•	h5: 1.125rem (18px)
	•	h6: 1rem (16px)

Line Height & Spacing
	•	Line height: minimum 1.5.
	•	Paragraph spacing: ≥ 1.5x line height.
	•	Avoid justified text.
	•	Avoid letter-spacing below 0.12em for uppercase text.

Font Face
	•	Use readable sans-serif fonts: system-ui, Arial, Helvetica, Roboto.
	•	Avoid decorative, script, or thin fonts.

⸻

Color & Contrast

Color Contrast
	•	Normal text: contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1.
	•	Large text: ≥ 3:1.
	•	UI components: ≥ 3:1 in all states.

Avoid Color-Only Indicators
	•	Use icons, text, or patterns to reinforce meaning.

Accessible States
	•	Provide clear, visible states for hover, focus, active, and disabled.

Dark Mode Support
	•	Light and dark themes must meet the same contrast standards.

⸻

Semantics & Structure

Semantic HTML
	•	Use HTML5 elements: <header>, <main>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>.
	•	Avoid <div> or <span> for meaningful content.

Heading Order
	•	Use headings in proper nested order.

Landmarks
	•	Use ARIA roles where appropriate: banner, navigation, main, contentinfo.

⸻

Keyboard Navigation & Interaction

Focusability
	•	Interactive elements must be accessible with Tab.

Focus Indicator
	•	Always display a visible focus outline.

Logical Tab Order
	•	Tab order must follow a logical flow.
	•	Avoid tabindex > 0.

Focus Traps
	•	Modals, overlays, and dropdowns must trap focus and be dismissible via Esc.

⸻

Behavior & Motion

Auto Motion
	•	No autoplay.
	•	Provide controls to pause/stop motion.

Reduced Motion Support

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
}

Tooltips & Popups
	•	Must be dismissible and keyboard accessible.
	•	Use role="tooltip" and aria-describedby.

⸻

Forms & Inputs

Labels
	•	Each input must have a <label>, aria-label, or aria-labelledby.

Placeholders
	•	Do not use as label replacements.

Error Messaging
	•	Visible in text.
	•	Not color-only.
	•	Linked to inputs via aria-describedby.

Fieldsets
	•	Use <fieldset> and <legend> to group related controls.

⸻

Component Accessibility (React/JS)

Buttons
	•	Use native <button>.
	•	Custom buttons must support ARIA and keyboard interaction.

Links
	•	Use <a href="#"> for navigation.
	•	Do not use <div> or <span> as links.

Custom Components
	•	Include role, ARIA attributes, and full keyboard handling.

ARIA Best Practices
	•	Use ARIA only when native HTML is insufficient.
	•	Avoid aria-hidden="true" on interactive elements.

⸻

Responsive & Mobile

Touch Targets
	•	Minimum size: 44px × 44px.

Zoom Support
	•	Do not disable zoom.

Viewport Meta Tag

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">


⸻

Accessibility Testing Requirements

Automated Testing
	•	Must pass:
	•	Lighthouse (100 score)
	•	axe-core
	•	WAVE

Manual Testing
	•	Screen readers: VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), NVDA (Windows)
	•	Full keyboard navigation.

⸻

Documentation & Code Comments
	•	Comment on accessibility implementations.
	•	Explain ARIA usage and rationale.

⸻

Summary Checklist
	•	Text contrast meets WCAG
	•	Semantic structure used
	•	Keyboard accessibility
	•	Visible focus states
